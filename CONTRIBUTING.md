   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build all packages

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

### Creating a Language Plugin

1. Create a new package in `packages/plugins/`
2. Implement the `LangPlugin` interface
3. Add tests for your plugin
4. Update documentation

Example structure:

```typescript
export const myPlugin: LangPlugin = {
  id: 'mylang',
  extensions: ['.ml'],
  async detect(filePath) {
    /* ... */
  },
  async extract(filePath) {
    /* ... */
  },
  async format(code) {
    /* ... */
  },
  async validate(cases, variantPath) {
    /* ... */
  },
  async benchmark(options) {
    /* ... */
  },
};
```

### Creating a Provider Adapter

1. Create a new package in `packages/adapters/`
2. Implement the `ProviderAdapter` interface
3. Add appropriate rate limiting and error handling
4. Update documentation

Example structure:

```typescript
export const myProvider: ProviderAdapter = {
  id: 'myprovider',
  name: 'My Provider',
  models: ['model-1', 'model-2'],
  async initialize(config) {
    /* ... */
  },
  async generateVariant(params) {
    /* ... */
  },
  estimateCost(params) {
    /* ... */
  },
  async isAvailable() {
    /* ... */
  },
};
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure 90%+ code coverage
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external API calls

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```
